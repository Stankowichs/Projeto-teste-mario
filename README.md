Game was created by me, with a lot of help from Alura's course Introduction to Programming Logic. The game is a recreation of Google's 'Dinosaur No Internet' game (I donâ€™t know the real name), but set in the Mario world. It still needs some updates, but it's pretty good for a first game and project
